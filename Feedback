The MATLAB code is thorough and hits all the major points. However, I would say always check to see that the data are plotted in a readable way especially when using subplots. Several of those graphs are so small that the legend blocks all the information
In Python, you should always include code that runs your modifications. While the modifications you made to *myder* look great - I want to make sure everyone knows how to run these programs.
